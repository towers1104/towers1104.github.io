<p>Kai-Owen<br><span class="verifiedpurchase">Verified Purchase</span><br><i><span class="reviews">Absolutely delicious!</span></i></p>

<p>Katie o.<br><span class="verifiedpurchase">Verified Purchase</span><br><span class="reviews"><i>It's astounding how far science has came. I like my water a bit on the thicker side, so adding a tiny bit of water to it allowed for the right consistency. Now anytime I go camping, I just bring this can and a few berries and I am good to go. Would be nice if they added dehydrated lemon to it as well. That way I can get that lemon water taste without actually going to the local Applebee's for it. This was a gift for my dad and he absolutely got a good laugh out of it. Thank you!</i></span></p>
